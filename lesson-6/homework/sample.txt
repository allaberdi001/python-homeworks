The warm afternoon sun cast long shadows across the quiet park, where a few scattered leaves rustled in the gentle breeze.
A lone bench sat beneath a towering oak tree, its wooden slats worn smooth by time and countless visitors.

Nearby, a small child laughed as they chased a butterfly, their tiny footsteps tapping against the pavement.
In the distance, the faint hum of traffic blended with the cheerful chirping of birds, creating a peaceful harmony.

It was one of those moments that felt suspended in time simple, fleeting, yet somehow unforgettable.
